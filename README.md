# Google Books API Search Engine

https://google-search-books.netlify.app/

## Purpose 

The purpose of this application is to provide a selection of books depending on what the user is searching for.


## Tech stack
- **React**
- **HTML** 
- **SCSS** 

## Challenges

The main issue I had was understanding the functionality of hooks; useState and useEffect. After creating multiple react apps and going throught the exercises, I was able to comprehend the importance of these hooks. 

Immediately, my attention went to fetching the API and utlizing async/await.

Overall, this application was a great way to learn how to use React, Hooks, Async/Await and Fetching API.


## MVP

Create a page that allows users to
Page should include the following:

-   Header section introducing the page
-   Form containing a text input and a submit / search button

-   A grid of books
    Instructions:

-   When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
-   The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
-   Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
-   The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
-   You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then

Styling (required):

This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and plan out your design. You can use tools like Figma or wireframe pro to plan what your application is going to look like.
Styling must use BEM, and each block should have its own SCSS file Your palette should use variables

Application Design (required):

-   You should separate DOM functions and non-DOM functions in different modules.
-   Write as many non-DOM functions as you can Functions should do 1 thing, and should be as pure and reusable as possible
-   Always use iterators over loops
-   Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
